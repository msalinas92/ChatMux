# 🤖 [BotName] – A Model-Agnostic Chatbot Engine (MCP-Compatible)

**[BotName]** is a future-proof chatbot framework designed to be **agnostic to the underlying LLM engine** and fully **compatible with MCP (Model Composition Protocol)**. Its mission is to provide developers and organizations with a flexible, extensible, and vendor-neutral foundation for building intelligent conversational agents that can integrate with **any** large language model — commercial or open source.

---

## 🎯 Vision

LLMs evolve fast. Locking into a single provider can limit innovation, increase costs, and reduce control.  
**[BotName]** solves this by decoupling chatbot logic from any specific model, allowing you to:

- Switch between LLM providers with zero friction.
- Combine multiple models using MCP routing, fallback, and chaining.
- Build composable, maintainable bots that adapt over time.

> 🧠 The bot shouldn't care whether it's talking to GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, or a self-hosted LLaMA — and neither should you.

## 🧩 Planned Features

### ✅ Core Architecture
- Model-agnostic abstraction layer for chat completions
- Unified interface for calling:
  - OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Google (Gemini)
  - Mistral
  - Cohere
  - Open-source models (LLaMA, MPT, Falcon, etc.)
- Extensible plugin system for:
  - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
  - Tool calling / function calling
  - Memory management
  - User context injection
  - Multilingual fallback

### 🔀 MCP Integration
- Native support for **Model Composition Protocol** (https://modelcomposition.org)
- Routing strategies (e.g. by content type, cost, latency)
- Fallback chains with graceful degradation
- Parallel model execution with consensus/aggregation

### 🛠️ Developer Features
- Hot-swappable provider configuration
- Built-in logging and tracing hooks
- Easy to integrate with LangChain, Semantic Kernel, or custom pipelines
- Support for local-first or edge deployments (e.g. WebLLM, Ollama)

### 💼 Enterprise-Ready Goals
- OpenTelemetry-compatible observability
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-tenant architecture (SaaS mode)
- API-first with OpenAPI spec
